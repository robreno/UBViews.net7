Theology constitutes the religious effort to define, clarify, expound, and justify the experiential claims of religion, which, in the last analysis, can be validated only by living faith. In the higher philosophy of the universe, wisdom, like reason, becomes allied to faith. Reason, wisdom, and faith are man’s highest human attainments. Reason introduces man to the world of facts, to things; wisdom introduces him to a world of truth, to relationships; faith initiates him into a world of divinity, spiritual experience." /></Paragraph><Paragraph seqId="98" uid="098.103.009.007" startTime="0:49:40.406" endTime="0:49:56.973" paraStyle="RegularParagraph" type="paragraph"><Run Style="{StaticResource RegularSpan}" Text="Faith most willingly carries reason along as far as reason can go and then goes on with wisdom to the full philosophic limit; and then it dares to launch out upon the limitless and never-ending universe journey in the sole company of truth." /></Paragraph><Paragraph seqId="99" uid="099.103.009.008" startTime="0:49:56.973" endTime="0:50:34.235" paraStyle="RegularParagraph" type="paragraph"><Run Style="{StaticResource RegularSpan}" Text="Science (knowledge) is founded on the inherent (adjutant spirit) assumption that reason is valid, that the universe can be comprehended.
