Money could never have been the motive for his betrayal of the Master." /></Paragraph><Paragraph seqId="139" uid="139.139.012.006" startTime="1:10:10.470" endTime="1:10:48.631" paraStyle="RegularParagraph" type="paragraph"><Run Style="{StaticResource RegularSpan}" Text="Judas was an only son of unwise parents.
