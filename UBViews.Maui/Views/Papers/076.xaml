From the distant days of the arrival of the corporeal staff of the Planetary Prince, down through the times of Van and Amadon to the arrival of Adam and Eve, physical representatives of the universe government had been stationed on the planet. But with the Adamic default this regime, extending over a period of more than four hundred and fifty thousand years, came to an end. In the spiritual spheres, angelic helpers continued to struggle in conjunction with the Thought Adjusters, both working heroically for the salvage of the individual; but no comprehensive plan for far-reaching world welfare was promulgated to the mortals of earth until the arrival of Machiventa Melchizedek, in the times of Abraham, who, with the power, patience, and authority of a Son of God, did lay the foundations for the further uplift and spiritual rehabilitation of unfortunate Urantia." /></FormattedString></Label.FormattedText></Label><Label x:Name="_076_046" Style="{StaticResource RegularParagraph}" ToolTipProperties.Text="76:5.7" attached:Audio.TimeSpan="0:22:4.297_0:22:56.913" attached:Ubml.UniqueId="046.076.005.007" attached:Ubml.SequenceId="76.46"><Label.GestureRecognizers><SwipeGestureRecognizer Direction="Left" Command="{Binding Source={RelativeSource AncestorType={x:Type viewmodel:XamlPaperViewModel}}, Path=SwipeGestureCommand}" CommandParameter="_076_046" /></Label.GestureRecognizers><Label.FormattedText><FormattedString><Span Style="{StaticResource TabsSpan}" /><Span x:Name="SP_076_046" Style="{StaticResource PID}" StyleId="76:5.7" Text="" /><Span Style="{StaticResource RegularSpaceSpan}" /><Span Style="{StaticResource RegularSpan}" Text="Misfortune has not, however, been the sole lot of Urantia; this planet has also been the most fortunate in the local universe of Nebadon.
