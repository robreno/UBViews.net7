Many a worshiper had experienced the humiliation of having his supposedly perfect animal rejected by the temple examiners. It therefore became the more general practice to purchase sacrificial animals at the temple, and although there were several stations on near-by Olivet where they could be bought, it had become the vogue to buy these animals directly from the temple pens. Gradually there had grown up this custom of selling all kinds of sacrificial animals in the temple courts.

At this time there was fostered an extensive system of banking and commercial exchange which was carried on right within the temple precincts. And this all came about in the following manner: During the Asmonean dynasty the Jews coined their own silver money, and it had become the practice to require the temple dues of one-half shekel and all other temple fees to be paid with this Jewish coin. This regulation necessitated that money-changers be licensed to exchange the many sorts of currency in circulation throughout Palestine and other provinces of the Roman Empire for this orthodox shekel of Jewish coining. The temple head tax, payable by all except women, slaves, and minors, was one-half shekel, a coin about the size of a ten-cent piece but twice as thick. By the times of Jesus the priests had also been exempted from the payment of temple dues. Accordingly, from the 15th to the 25th of the month preceding the Passover, accredited money-changers erected their booths in the principal cities of Palestine for the purpose of providing the Jewish people with proper money to meet the temple dues after they had reached Jerusalem. After this ten-day period these money-changers moved on to Jerusalem and proceeded to set up their exchange tables in the courts of the temple. They were permitted to charge the equivalent of from three to four cents commission for the exchange of a coin valued at about ten cents, and in case a coin of larger value was offered for exchange, they were allowed to collect double. Likewise did these temple bankers profit from the exchange of all money intended for the purchase of sacrificial animals and for the payment of vows and the making of offerings." /></FormattedString></Label.FormattedText></Label><Label x:Name="_173_009" Style="{StaticResource RegularParagraph}" ToolTipProperties.Text="173:1.4" attached:Audio.TimeSpan="0:5:20.950_0:5:54.787" attached:Ubml.UniqueId="009.173.001.004" attached:Ubml.SequenceId="173.9"><Label.GestureRecognizers><TapGestureRecognizer NumberOfTapsRequired="1" Command="{Binding Source={RelativeSource AncestorType={x:Type viewmodel:XamlPaperViewModel}}, Path=TappedGestureCommand}" CommandParameter="_173_009" /><SwipeGestureRecognizer Direction="Left" Command="{Binding Source={RelativeSource AncestorType={x:Type viewmodel:XamlPaperViewModel}}, Path=SwipeGestureCommand}" CommandParameter="_173_009" /></Label.GestureRecognizers><Label.FormattedText><FormattedString><Span Style="{StaticResource TabsSpan}" /><Span x:Name="SP_173_009" Style="{StaticResource PID}" StyleId="173:1.4" Text="" /><Span Style="{StaticResource RegularSpaceSpan}" /><Span Style="{StaticResource RegularSpan}" Text="These temple money-changers not only conducted a regular banking business for profit in the exchange of more than twenty sorts of money which the visiting pilgrims would periodically bring to Jerusalem, but they also engaged in all other kinds of transactions pertaining to the banking business.
