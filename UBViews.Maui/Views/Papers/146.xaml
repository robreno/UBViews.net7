Although Jesus told them the boy was merely in a deep sleep, they explained that that was the manner of his speaking and called attention to the fact that he always in great modesty tried to hide his miracles." /></FormattedString></Label.FormattedText></Label><Label x:Name="_146_055" Style="{StaticResource RegularParagraph}" ToolTipProperties.Text="146:6.4" attached:Audio.TimeSpan="0:36:8.958_0:36:45.563" attached:Ubml.UniqueId="055.146.006.004" attached:Ubml.SequenceId="146.55"><Label.GestureRecognizers><TapGestureRecognizer NumberOfTapsRequired="1" Command="{Binding Source={RelativeSource AncestorType={x:Type viewmodel:XamlPaperViewModel}}, Path=TappedGestureCommand}" CommandParameter="_146_055" /><SwipeGestureRecognizer Direction="Left" Command="{Binding Source={RelativeSource AncestorType={x:Type viewmodel:XamlPaperViewModel}}, Path=SwipeGestureCommand}" CommandParameter="_146_055" /></Label.GestureRecognizers><Label.FormattedText><FormattedString><Span Style="{StaticResource TabsSpan}" /><Span x:Name="SP_146_055" Style="{StaticResource PID}" StyleId="146:6.4" Text="" /><Span Style="{StaticResource RegularSpaceSpan}" /><Span Style="{StaticResource RegularSpan}" Text="So the word went abroad throughout Galilee and into Judea that Jesus had raised the widow’s son from the dead, and many who heard this report believed it.
