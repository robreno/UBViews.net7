Again I declare that my kingdom is not of this world; but if the Son of Man had been accorded the spiritual rule of his people, he would have accepted such a kingdom of men’s souls and would have reigned over such a dominion of human hearts. Notwithstanding that they reject my spiritual rule over them, I will return again to receive from others such a kingdom of spirit as is now denied me. You will see the Son of Man rejected now, but in another age that which the children of Abraham now reject will be received and exalted." /></FormattedString></Label.FormattedText></Label><Label x:Name="_171_063" Style="{StaticResource RegularParagraph}" ToolTipProperties.Text="171:8.4" attached:Audio.TimeSpan="0:34:30.960_0:34:57.718" attached:Ubml.UniqueId="063.171.008.004" attached:Ubml.SequenceId="171.63"><Label.GestureRecognizers><SwipeGestureRecognizer Direction="Left" Command="{Binding Source={RelativeSource AncestorType={x:Type viewmodel:XamlPaperViewModel}}, Path=SwipeGestureCommand}" CommandParameter="_171_063" /></Label.GestureRecognizers><Label.FormattedText><FormattedString><Span Style="{StaticResource TabsSpan}" /><Span x:Name="SP_171_063" Style="{StaticResource PID}" StyleId="171:8.4" Text="" /><Span Style="{StaticResource RegularSpaceSpan}" /><Span Style="{StaticResource RegularSpan}" Text="“And now, as the rejected nobleman of this parable, I would call before me my twelve servants, special stewards, and giving into each of your hands the sum of one pound, I would admonish each to heed well my instructions that you trade diligently with your trust fund while I am away that you may have wherewith to justify your stewardship when I return, when a reckoning shall be required of you." /></FormattedString></Label.FormattedText></Label><Label x:Name="_171_064" Style="{StaticResource RegularParagraph}" ToolTipProperties.Text="171:8.5" attached:Audio.TimeSpan="0:34:57.718_0:35:13.619" attached:Ubml.UniqueId="064.171.008.005" attached:Ubml.SequenceId="171.64"><Label.GestureRecognizers><SwipeGestureRecognizer Direction="Left" Command="{Binding Source={RelativeSource AncestorType={x:Type viewmodel:XamlPaperViewModel}}, Path=SwipeGestureCommand}" CommandParameter="_171_064" /></Label.GestureRecognizers><Label.FormattedText><FormattedString><Span Style="{StaticResource TabsSpan}" /><Span x:Name="SP_171_064" Style="{StaticResource PID}" StyleId="171:8.5" Text="" /><Span Style="{StaticResource RegularSpaceSpan}" /><Span Style="{StaticResource RegularSpan}" Text="“And even if this rejected Son should not return, another Son will be sent to receive this kingdom, and this Son will then send for all of you to receive your report of stewardship and to be made glad by your gains." /></FormattedString></Label.FormattedText></Label><Label x:Name="_171_065" Style="{StaticResource RegularParagraph}" ToolTipProperties.Text="171:8.6" attached:Audio.TimeSpan="0:35:13.619_0:36:37.809" attached:Ubml.UniqueId="065.171.008.006" attached:Ubml.SequenceId="171.65"><Label.GestureRecognizers><SwipeGestureRecognizer Direction="Left" Command="{Binding Source={RelativeSource AncestorType={x:Type viewmodel:XamlPaperViewModel}}, Path=SwipeGestureCommand}" CommandParameter="_171_065" /></Label.GestureRecognizers><Label.FormattedText><FormattedString><Span Style="{StaticResource TabsSpan}" /><Span x:Name="SP_171_065" Style="{StaticResource PID}" StyleId="171:8.6" Text="" /><Span Style="{StaticResource RegularSpaceSpan}" /><Span Style="{StaticResource RegularSpan}" Text="“And when these stewards were subsequently called together for an accounting, the first came forward, saying, ‘Lord, with your pound I have made ten pounds more.’ And his master said to him: ‘Well done; you are a good servant; because you have proved faithful in this matter, I will give you authority over ten cities.’ And the second came, saying, ‘Your pound left with me, Lord, has made five pounds.’ And the master said, ‘I will accordingly make you ruler over five cities.’ And so on down through the others until the last of the servants, on being called to account, reported: ‘Lord, behold, here is your pound, which I have kept safely done up in this napkin.
