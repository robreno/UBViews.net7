It was, indeed and in truth, the will of the Father that his Son should drink to the full the cup of mortal experience, from birth to death, but the Father in heaven had nothing whatever to do with instigating the barbarous behavior of those supposedly civilized human beings who so brutally tortured the Master and so horribly heaped successive indignities upon his nonresisting person.

Judas explained to his associates that they had missed Jesus at the Mark home, and that it would be necessary to go to Gethsemane to arrest him. The betrayer then went on to state that more than threescore devoted followers were encamped with him, and that they were all well armed. The rulers of the Jews reminded Judas that Jesus had always preached nonresistance, but Judas replied that they could not depend upon all Jesus’ followers obeying such teaching. He really feared for himself and therefore made bold to ask for a company of forty armed soldiers. Since the Jewish authorities had no such force of armed men under their jurisdiction, they went at once to the fortress of Antonia and requested the Roman commander to give them this guard; but when he learned that they intended to arrest Jesus, he promptly refused to accede to their request and referred them to his superior officer. In this way more than an hour was consumed in going from one authority to another until they finally were compelled to go to Pilate himself in order to obtain permission to employ the armed Roman guards. It was late when they arrived at Pilate’s house, and he had retired to his private chambers with his wife. He hesitated to have anything to do with the enterprise, all the more so since his wife had asked him not to grant the request.

He has the courage to come forward to be with his Master, and no man shall lay hands on him. The Roman law allows that any prisoner may have at least one friend to stand with him before the judgment bar, and this man shall not be prevented from standing by the side of his Master, the prisoner.” And when Judas heard this, he was so ashamed and humiliated that he dropped back behind the marchers, coming up to the palace of Annas alone." /></FormattedString></Label.FormattedText></Label><Label x:Name="_183_039" Style="{StaticResource RegularParagraph}" ToolTipProperties.Text="183:5.4" attached:Audio.TimeSpan="0:23:9.702_0:24:13.639" attached:Ubml.UniqueId="039.183.005.004" attached:Ubml.SequenceId="183.39"><Label.GestureRecognizers><TapGestureRecognizer NumberOfTapsRequired="1" Command="{Binding Source={RelativeSource AncestorType={x:Type viewmodel:XamlPaperViewModel}}, Path=TappedGestureCommand}" CommandParameter="_183_039" /><TapGestureRecognizer NumberOfTapsRequired="2" Command="{Binding Source={RelativeSource AncestorType={x:Type viewmodel:XamlPaperViewModel}}, Path=DoubleTappedGestureForPaperCommand}" CommandParameter="_183_039" /></Label.GestureRecognizers><Label.FormattedText><FormattedString><Span Style="{StaticResource TabsSpan}" /><Span x:Name="SP_183_039" Style="{StaticResource PID}" StyleId="183:5.4" Text="" /><Span Style="{StaticResource RegularSpaceSpan}" /><Span Style="{StaticResource RegularSpan}" Text="And this explains why John Zebedee was permitted to remain near Jesus all the way through his trying experiences this night and the next day.

John’s position of privilege was made all the more secure when, in turning Jesus over to the captain of the temple guards at the gate of Annas’s palace, the Roman, addressing his assistant, said: “Go along with this prisoner and see that these Jews do not kill him without Pilate’s consent. Watch that they do not assassinate him, and see that his friend, the Galilean, is permitted to stand by and observe all that goes on.” And thus was John able to be near Jesus right on up to the time of his death on the cross, though the other ten apostles were compelled to remain in hiding.
