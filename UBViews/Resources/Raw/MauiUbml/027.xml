Never since the times of Grandfanda have the supernaphim been able fully to accommodate the spirit of worship on Paradise. Always is there an excess of worshipfulness as gauged by the preparation therefor. And this is because personalities of inherent perfection never can fully appreciate the tremendous reactions of the spiritual emotions of beings who have slowly and laboriously made their way upward to Paradise glory from the depths of the spiritual darkness of the lower worlds of time and space. When such angels and mortals of time attain the presence of the Powers of Paradise, there occurs the expression of the accumulated emotions of the ages, a spectacle astounding to the angels of Paradise and productive of the supreme joy of divine satisfaction in the Paradise Deities." /></Paragraph><Paragraph seqId="53" uid="053.027.007.007" startTime="0:25:24.0" endTime="0:26:8.100" paraStyle="RegularParagraph" type="paragraph"><Run Style="{StaticResource RegularSpan}" Text="Sometimes all Paradise becomes engulfed in a dominating tide of spiritual and worshipful expression.
