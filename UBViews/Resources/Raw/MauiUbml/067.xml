This verdict failed to reach him because the planetary circuits of communication were severed while it was in transit. Only recently was this actual ruling discovered lodged in the possession of a relay energy transmitter where it had been marooned ever since the isolation of Urantia. Without this discovery, made as the result of the investigations of the Urantia midwayers, the release of this decision would have awaited the restoration of Urantia to the constellation circuits. And this apparent accident of interplanetary communication was possible because energy transmitters can receive and transmit intelligence, but they cannot initiate communication." /></Paragraph><Paragraph seqId="52" uid="052.067.006.010" startTime="0:26:24.980" endTime="0:26:36.696" paraStyle="RegularParagraph" type="paragraph"><Run Style="{StaticResource RegularSpan}" Text="The technical status of Van on the legal records of Satania was not actually and finally settled until this ruling of the Edentia Fathers was recorded on Jerusem." /></Paragraph><Paragraph seqId="53" uid="053.067.007.000" startTime="0:26:36.696" endTime="0:26:42.178" paraStyle="SectionParagraph" type="section"><Run Style="{StaticResource SectionSpan}" Text="7.
