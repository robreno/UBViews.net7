You are not really a child of Paradise until you have traversed the inner circle and have experienced the resurrection of eternity from the terminal sleep of time. The perfected pilgrims begin this rest, go to sleep, on the first circle of Havona, but they awaken on the shores of Paradise. Of all who ascend to the eternal Isle, only those who thus arrive are the children of eternity; the others go as visitors, as guests without residential status." /></Paragraph><Paragraph seqId="101" uid="101.026.011.007" startTime="0:44:43.0" endTime="0:45:25.0" paraStyle="RegularParagraph" type="paragraph"><Run Style="{StaticResource RegularSpan}" Text="And now, at the culmination of the Havona career, as you mortals go to sleep on the pilot world of the inner circuit, you go not alone to your rest as you did on the worlds of your origin when you closed your eyes in the natural sleep of mortal death, nor as you did when you entered the long transit trance preparatory for the journey to Havona. Now, as you prepare for the attainment rest, there moves over by your side your long-time associate of the first circle, the majestic complement of rest, who prepares to enter the rest as one with you, as the pledge of Havona that your transition is complete, and that you await only the final touches of perfection." /></Paragraph><Paragraph seqId="102" uid="102.026.011.008" startTime="0:45:25.0" endTime="0:45:37.0" paraStyle="RegularParagraph" type="paragraph"><Run Style="{StaticResource RegularSpan}" Text="Your first transition was indeed death, the second an ideal sleep, and now the third metamorphosis is the true rest, the relaxation of the ages." /></Paragraph><Paragraph seqId="103" uid="103.026.011.009" startTime="0:45:37.0" endTime="0:45:43.0" paraStyle="SponsorParagraph" type="paragraph"><Run Style="{StaticResource RegularSpan}" Text="[Presented by a Perfector of Wisdom from Uversa.]" /></Paragraph></Content>
